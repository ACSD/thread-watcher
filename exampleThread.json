Unless they are quality, well thought out, well written posts, the following are some examples of off-topic and/or /b/-tier threads:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Red pill me on X. (with no extra content or input of your own)</span><br>\n<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are X white?</span><br>\n<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is X degeneracy?</span><br>\n<span class=\"quote\">&gt;How come X girls love Y guys so much?</span><br>\n<span class=\"quote\">&gt;If X is true, then how come Y? Checkmate Z.</span><br>\n<br>\nThe variety of threads allowed here are very flexible and we believe in freedom of speech, but we expect a high level of discourse befitting of the board.
